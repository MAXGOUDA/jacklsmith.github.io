		<p class="intro-paragraph">Plot is an iPhone app for discovering, planning, and sharing the movies you watch.</p>
		<p>I've been working on Plot alongside Ben Howdle, leading the design side of things, while Ben focuses on development.</p>
		<p>Fustrated by the hordes of bloated and poorly designed solutions out there, we wanted to build a simple and slick app for sharing and reviewing what you watch, collating the movies you want to see, and a base to explore numerous ideas around movie discovery.</p>
		<p>We've got a load of cool things planned with Plot, so get involved and download it today.</p>
