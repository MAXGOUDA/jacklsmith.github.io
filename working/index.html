		<p class="intro-paragraph">Plot is an iPhone app for discovering, planning, and sharing the movies you watch.</p>
		<p>I've been working on Plot alongside <a href="http://benhowdle.im/">Ben Howdle</a>, leading the design side of things, while Ben focuses on development.</p>
		<p>Fustrated by the hordes of bloated and poorly designed solutions out there, we wanted to build a simple and slick app for sharing and reviewing what you watch, collating the movies you want to see, and a base to explore numerous ideas around movie discovery.</p>
		<p>We've got a load of cool things planned with Plot, so get involved and <a href="itunes.apple.com/gb/app/plot-discover-track-movies/id922985808" title="Download Plot movies">download it today</a>.</p>	</article>

		<h2 class="project-title">Hailo <a href="https://www.hailoapp.com" title="Visit Hailo" class="visit-project-link">hailoapp.com</a></h2>
		<p class="intro-paragraph">Hailo is a free mobile app which puts people two taps away from a licensed taxi or executive car.</p>
		<p>By summer 2014, Hailo was available in 7 countries and experiencing relentless growth, while shipping consistent improvements to their beautiful iOS and Android apps. Their web platform however, had been heavily rejected thus far.</p>
		<p>I worked with Hailo to produce a new version of their website. Leading the design and contributing to the front-end development, we managed to release a V1 within a 10 week period.</p>
		<p>I also worked on a new web styleguide, initially providing the base for the new website, but also providing design pattterns for numerous internal tools and web based products in the future.</p>

		<h2 class="project-title">Mastered <a href="https://www.mastered.com" title="Visit Mastered" class="visit-project-link">mastered.com</a></h2>
		<p class="intro-paragraph">Mastered are a London based startup aiming to help fashion designers forge a business or career out of their passion.</p>
		<p>I designed the app and built the front-end while working alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/svileng" title="Svilen Gospodinov">two</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/oguzcanhuner" title="Oz Huner">talented</a> Rails developers. Version 1 of Mastered was put together over a fast-paced 2 month period, and launched at the start of 2014. Since then I've been designing features to improve the learning experience.</p>
		<p>Bringing high quality online education to the fashion industry has been incredibly satisfying. Mastered is the first of its kind, helping provide opportunities and a clear career path for designer-makers of all ages, while avoiding the high costs and limited access to degrees.</p>

		<h2 class="project-title">Trailed <a href="http://trailed.io" title="Visit Trailed" class="visit-project-link">trailed.io</a></h2>
		<p class="intro-paragraph">Trailed is a web app for creating conversation using one of the internet's most resilient platforms, blogging.</p>
		<p>Collaborating with my friend, and talented JavaScript developer, <a href="http://benhowdle.im/">Ben Howdle</a>, we wanted to embrace the recent movement of <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/">Indie Web</a>, and create an app to improve discussion around blogging.</p>
		<p>The feature set is relatively simple but the idea is bigger. We're rejecting comment systems in favour of writers responding to content via their own blogs, with their own articles being shared as "responses" inside a Trail.</p>
		<p>The app is essentially a platform for sharing your writing, whether it's the post that starts a Trail, or a response to share your opinion on another author's article.</p>

		<h2 class="project-title">Striving <a href="http://striving.me" title="Visit Striving" class="visit-project-link">striving.me</a></h2>
		<p class="intro-paragraph">Striving is a network designed to help you achieve what matters most in life â€” goals and aspirations.</p>
		<p>Everything you do in life comes down to what you want to achieve next. No matter how big or small your goals may be, sharing them with other people makes them easier to conquer. The mission behind Striving is to get people connected, by working together to achieve goals, and potentially meeting new people and friends in the process. By posting your goals and networking with others, you can start building connections, and receive helping hands from friendly folk within the community.</p>
		<p>I'm working on Striving alongside <a href="http://michaelwright.me/" title="Michael Wright">Michael Wright</a> and <a href="http://daneden.me/" title="Dan Eden">Dan Eden</a>, leading the front with the design and product development.</p>

		<h2 class="project-title">Brokers Direct <a href="http://brokersdirect.co.uk" title="Visit Brokers Direct" class="visit-project-link">brokersdirect.co.uk</a></h2>
		<p class="intro-paragraph">Brokers Direct are an insurance provider based in Scotland. I worked with them to produce a responsive website redesign.</p>
		<p>The project introduced various improvements. The content was rewritten from scratch, now far more concise, useful, and (hopefully!) interesting. Visually, the redesign made key product information far easier to find (no longer buried within reams of copy), while also providing more of a spotlight for the content elsewhere on the website. Meanwhile, I introduced a whole new base style-guide for the web to complement the existing brand.</p>
		<p>While the quote system remained untouched, the new design base has ultimately laid down the foundations for some exciting plans in the future.</p>

		<p class="intro-paragraph">A slick, minimal design revamp for Substrakt's online presence.</p>
		<p>Substrakt is where I worked for almost 2 years, and during the early months of 2012, we decided that substrakt.co.uk and the overall branding needed a bit of an overhaul.</p>
		<p>Design wise, we wanted to produce a minimal, flat colour layout, with heavy emphasis on slick typography and strong imagery, namely the growing portfolio! Ultimately, this needed to be a future proof design that could evolve over time. Working alongside the talented design duo of <a href="https://twitter.com/jim_b" title="James Braithwaite">Jim</a> and <a href="http://www.ryandc.co.uk/" title="Ryan Dean-Corke">Ryan</a>, Substrakt 2012 was designed in the browser, embracing the opportunities of CSS3 and responsive design techniques.</p>
		<p>After a soft launch in July, the response from the design community, other local agencies, and our clients was incredibly positive. It was also featured as <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/web-design-awards/substrakt" title="Substrakt on Awwwards">site of the day</a> on Awwwards.

		<h2 class="project-title">Ikon <a href="http://ikon-gallery.org" title="Visit Ikon" class="visit-project-link">ikon-gallery.org</a></h2>
		<p class="intro-paragraph">Ikon is a internationally acclaimed contemporary art venue in Birmingham, UK. They required a responsive redesign of their website.</p>
		<p>This was my final project while at Substrakt. I led on the initial UX and visual design planning, and handed over to the team's developers during my departure.</p>
		<p>The key aims of the redesign were to bring more focus to their collection of brilliant and immersive content, creating relationships between the various events, resources, and products, and creating a design and front-end build that responds to display beautifully on any kind of device.</p>
		<p>The website launched in October 2013 to some fantastic feedback.</p>
