				<p class="intro-paragraph">Plot is an iPhone app for discovering, planning, and sharing the movies you watch.</p>
				<p>I've been working on Plot alongside <a href="http://benhowdle.im/">Ben Howdle</a>, leading the design side of things, while Ben focuses on development.</p>
				<p>Fustrated by the hordes of bloated and poorly designed solutions out there, we wanted to build a simple and slick app for sharing and reviewing what you watch, collating the movies you want to see, and a base to explore numerous ideas around movie discovery.</p>
				<p>We've got a load of cool things planned with Plot, so get involved and <a href="itunes.apple.com/gb/app/plot-discover-track-movies/id922985808" title="Download Plot movies">download it today</a>.</p>

				<p class="intro-paragraph">Hailo is a free mobile app which puts people two taps away from a licensed taxi or executive car.</p>
				<p>By summer 2014, Hailo was available in 7 countries and experiencing relentless growth, while shipping consistent improvements to their beautiful iOS and Android apps. Their web platform however, had been heavily rejected thus far.</p>
				<p>I worked with Hailo to produce a new version of their website. Leading the design and contributing to the front-end development, we managed to release a V1 within a 10 week period.</p>
				<p>I also worked on a new web styleguide, initially providing the base for the new website, but also providing design pattterns for numerous internal tools and web based products in the future.</p>

				<p class="intro-paragraph">Mastered are a London based startup aiming to help fashion designers forge a business or career out of their passion.</p>
				<p>I designed the app and built the front-end while working alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/svileng" title="Svilen Gospodinov">two</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/oguzcanhuner" title="Oz Huner">talented</a> Rails developers. Version 1 of Mastered was put together over a fast-paced 2 month period, and launched at the start of 2014. Since then I've been designing features to improve the learning experience.</p>
				<p>Bringing high quality online education to the fashion industry has been incredibly satisfying. Mastered is the first of its kind, helping provide opportunities and a clear career path for designer-makers of all ages, while avoiding the high costs and limited access to degrees.</p>
