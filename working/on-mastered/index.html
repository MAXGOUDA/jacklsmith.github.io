		<p class="intro-paragraph">Mastered are a London based startup aiming to help fashion designers forge a business or career out of their passion.</p>
		<p>I designed the app and built the front-end while working alongside two talented Rails developers. Version 1 of Mastered was put together over a fast-paced 2 month period, and launched at the start of 2014. Since then I've been designing features to improve the learning experience.</p>
		<p>Bringing high quality online education to the fashion industry has been incredibly satisfying. Mastered is the first of its kind, helping provide opportunities and a clear career path for designer-makers of all ages, while avoiding the high costs and limited access to degrees.</p>
