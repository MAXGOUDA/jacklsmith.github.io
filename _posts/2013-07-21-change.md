Sometimes it can be incredibly difficult to settle on change as the solution to discontent. It's disruptive, hard work, and often terrifying.

Burying those urges happens far too easily, it's what we naturally do. But if that simmering idea refuses to go away, do yourself a favour and act on it.

Change can instigate a brutally fast path of learning, new perspectives and ideas, answers, and ultimately, after all the stress and anxiety, complete contentment.

I've changed a lot of things over the last few months. It's been worth every sleepless night.
