<p class="intro-paragraph">I'm Jack Smith, a digital product designer and front-end developer based in Nottingham, England.</p>
<p>I mainly specialise in designing user interfaces for both the web and mobile applications. Crafting brilliant user experiences and stand-out products is what I'm truly passionate about, and there's nothing I enjoy more than achieving this through innovative design.</p>
<p>My other skill-set lies in front-end development. HTML, Sass, and interaction/animation based JavaScript.</p>
<p>My experience includes working for agencies, startups, and as a freelancer. Read on for more about how I work, and let me know if you're interested in working together.</p>
