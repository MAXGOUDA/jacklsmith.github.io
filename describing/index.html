<p class="intro-paragraph">I'm Jack Smith, a digital designer based in Barcelona (London from August 2018).</p>
<p>I specialise in designing user interfaces for both the web and mobile applications. Creating brilliant digital products is what I'm truly passionate about, and there's nothing I enjoy more than achieving this through exciting, trustworthy, robust design.</p>
<p>I'm experienced in various parts of the design process â€” early stage research and product direction, prototyping and user testing, along with basic front-end development (html/sass + small amounts of javascript).</p>
<p>My design role history includes working for agencies, startups, and as a freelancer. Read on for more about how I work, and let me know if you're interested in working together.</p>
