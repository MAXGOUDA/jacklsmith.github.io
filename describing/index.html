<p class="intro-paragraph">I'm Jack Smith, a digital product designer and front-end developer based in London, England.</p>
<p>I mainly specialise in designing user interfaces for both the web and mobile applications. Crafting brilliant user experiences and stand-out products is what I'm truly passionate about, and there's nothing I enjoy more than achieving this through innovative design.</p>
<p>My other skill-set lies in front-end development. I've been laying down scalable HTML and CSS for over 5 years, and utilising JavaScript for interaction and animation.</p>
<p>My experience includes working for agencies, startups, and as a freelancer. As of May 2015, I have some availability upcoming. Let me know if you're interested in working together.</p>
